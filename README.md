# AstronomyCal
creates a single ics file of all astronomical events in an year with data provided by astropixels.com and seasky.org

# Ideal conditions for viewing

1. No bright lights around
2. No air pollution
3. No moonlight 


## Light Pollution
If you go to the countryside or area outside a town on a clear night you will see many more stars than you would do in the city. The reason why you cannot see so many stars in a city is light pollution.

## Air Pollution
info needed

## Moonlight
The moon is beautiful for sure, but it can be too big and annoying especially when you want to see meteor showers and comets. The ideal time for observations is during new moon. Since not everyday is new moon, before moonrise and after moonset are ideal timings too.
